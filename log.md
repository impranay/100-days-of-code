# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5th, 2017 (

**Today's Progress**: Built a dashboard wireframe for a stealth AI startup and will submit them for review. 

**Thoughts:** I had already built them one with bootstrap library but thought they deserve better and built that again with using Semantic UI. Some powerful stuff Semantic UI is when comes to frontend development definitely shifting towards this framework. Feeling alright with the pace. Will work around more next morning. Night! Also trying to install surge and will try it over the period of hour so if nothing happens then will shift it to git !
