# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 5th, 2017 (

**Today's Progress**: Built a dashboard wireframe for a stealth AI startup and will submit them for review. 

**Thoughts:** I had already built them one with bootstrap library but thought they deserve better and built that again with using Semantic UI. Some powerful stuff Semantic UI is when comes to frontend development definitely shifting towards this framework. Feeling alright with the pace. Will work around more next morning. Night! Also trying to install surge and will try it over the period of hour so if nothing happens then will shift it to git !

### Day 1: December 6th, 2017 (

**Today's Progress**: Built a dashboard wireframe for a stealth AI startup and will submit them for review. **(GULP BUILD)**

**Thoughts:** So apparently I have been applaused for the effort from the team at stealth AI startup. Though it wasn't responsive I'm still thinking of rebuilding the much more diverse functionality into the wireframe and built a structured Front-End. As I believe the problem lies in the CDN build as I collided with technical barrier over the issue of simple gulp install which is something to do with my OS. Lot of work is required in the background will proly sit onto this and will start working on the wireframe to frontend, just for the knack of it. :D

**Today's Progress**: Worked first time on Mobile First Application

**Thoughts:** So decided to give a try to the blog idea from Dribble site for the mobile first site. It was the simple blog idea and I read it from the freecodecamp blog for giving it a try just to test the current skill level. And I had to say it was tough getting it all back. But will work on, this is a process will definetly gonna catch the train. Lol. Got pretty good repsonse from community over twitter. Offtopic- And I don't know but Edie Murphy - Party All the Time sounds good while coding idk why ? ! lol
